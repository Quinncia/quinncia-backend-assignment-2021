# Quinncia 2021 Backend Developer Position Assignment

Description:
> We created a mini-server with just one endpoint for our imaginary money exchange service to generate a report on payments for us. It only has about 120 lines of code but unfortunately it is not the best solution with several issues. Your goal is to quickly identify the issues and correct them in the code. Optionally, you can just list things you do not like instead of working on the code. 

<br>

**Assumed tech**:
- NodeJS
- Koa framework
- Mongoose (mongoDB)

<br>

**If you decide to edit the file**:

> You can either fork the repository or send us an updated copy via email, whichever works better for you. You can make as many changes as you'd like, as well as add any npm library you might find useful for a better implementation (just "import" them, no package.json needed). You can also implement your own functions instead of using any additional npm modules 

<br>

**If you only want to create a list of issues you see**:

> This is less desirable, but in case some issues are obvious to you and you would like to elaborate on them during our technical interview, you can do so as well. Create a list with every item containing the line of code from where an issue starts, describe the issue and propose a solution
